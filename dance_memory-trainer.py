# Step 1: Setup - Import Libraries and Define Dance_Moves

# We use the random module to shuffle and extend the dance sequence each round.
# We learned how to use random.choice() from Python documentation and examples online!
import random  # helps to shuffle random dance moves in each round

# matplotlib is a library we looked up and learned to use for visualizing performance data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # used to create a graph of the player's performance after the game

Dance_Moves = [
    "spin - turn to your right", 
    "pop - sharp chest movement", 
    "slide left - slide to the left", 
    "slide right - slide to the right",
    "lock - freeze your arms in place",
    "wave - ripple your arms",
    "jump - quick hop in place",
    "clap - clap your hands",
    "snap - snap your fingers on dominate hand",
    "kick right - kick right leg",
    "kick left - kick left leg",
    "dip - bend knees quickly"
]

# Step 2: Define Game Class
